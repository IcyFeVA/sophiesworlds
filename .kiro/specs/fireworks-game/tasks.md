# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create fireworks game directory structure and basic files



  - Create gameFireworks directory with scripts/, go/, and collection files
  - Set up basic gameFireworks.collection file with controller game object
  - Create placeholder controller.script and fireworksSpawner.script files
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement core fireworks controller script
  - Write controller.script with input handling following existing game patterns
  - Implement screen-to-world coordinate conversion using rendercam
  - Add multitouch support with activeTouches tracking table
  - Create firework spawning function that triggers particle effects at touch locations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Create fireworks particle effect system
  - Design and implement particles/fireworks.particlefx with multiple emitters
  - Configure primary explosion emitter with radial particle burst
  - Add secondary sparkle trail emitter for enhanced visual appeal
  - Include tertiary flash effect emitter for initial explosion brightness
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement fireworks spawner script for particle management
  - Write fireworksSpawner.script to handle particle effect lifecycle
  - Add color randomization system using predefined color palette
  - Implement automatic cleanup of completed particle effects with timers
  - Add performance optimization with maximum active fireworks limit
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Add sound effects integration
  - Integrate firework explosion sound effects in controller script
  - Implement sound variation and pitch randomization for variety
  - Add proper sound layering for multiple simultaneous fireworks
  - _Requirements: 1.4_

- [ ] 6. Integrate fireworks game with main script proxy system
  - Add gameFireworksProxy to main.collection
  - Update main.script to handle "fireworks" game_id in launch_game message
  - Add input routing for fireworks game in main script on_input function
  - Test proxy loading and unloading functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 5.3_

- [ ] 7. Update game selector to include fireworks game
  - Add fireworks game entry to games table in gameSelector.gui_script
  - Create fireworks button with appropriate color and styling
  - Test button click handling and game launching
  - _Requirements: 4.1_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive test suite for fireworks functionality
  - Write unit tests for input handling and coordinate conversion
  - Test multitouch support with multiple simultaneous touches
  - Verify particle effect spawning and cleanup mechanisms
  - Test performance with maximum simultaneous fireworks
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement performance optimizations and resource management
  - Add particle effect pooling to reuse instances efficiently
  - Implement memory cleanup for completed effects
  - Add frame rate monitoring and optimization
  - Test cross-platform compatibility (desktop mouse and mobile touch)
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Final integration testing and polish
  - Test complete game flow from selector to fireworks and back
  - Verify all requirements are met through end-to-end testing
  - Add any missing visual polish or sound effects
  - Ensure consistent behavior across different screen resolutions
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 5.4_
